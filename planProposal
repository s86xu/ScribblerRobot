Proposal: 

That we creat a maze mapper using the robot, and make it solve the maze. this includes the use of line sensor, which meets the requirement of using at least one sensor. and it is kinda fun to map out the maze into an image that people can see on the program. Instead of just making a name like everyone else, I think we can take on something more challenging instead.
